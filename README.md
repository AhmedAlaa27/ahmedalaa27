# Ahmed Alaa

Backend Developer with a strong foundation in Machine Learning & AI.

I focus on building robust backend systems grounded in solid mathematical and architectural understanding.  
My approach prioritizes logic, system design, and clean abstractions before implementation.

## Core Focus

- Designing backend systems with clear boundaries and strong data integrity
- Building APIs that respect constraints, consistency, and scalability
- Applying machine learning with solid mathematical grounding
- Thinking in abstractions before thinking in frameworks
- Writing code that remains understandable under growth and change
